# dotfiles
Dotfiles for shell config

I followed [this tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) to set it up.

## Installation

Run `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evan-ziebart/dotfiles/main/install.sh)"`. You may need to back up existing dotfiles before you do.
